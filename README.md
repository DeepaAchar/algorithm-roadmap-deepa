# 🎯 Deepa's Algorithm Learning Journey

Welcome to my personalized roadmap through algorithm fundamentals, advanced data structures, and real-world applications.

## 🧭 Phase Overview

- **Phase 1:** Foundations — Big O, recursion, basic sorting/searching
- **Phase 2:** Core DSA — Trees, graphs, hashing, dynamic programming
- **Phase 3:** Advanced — String similarity, bit manipulation, tries
- **Phase 4:** Real-world Projects — APIs, rate-limiting, graph analytics

## 📌 Goal
Master algorithms for scalable backend, full-stack and cloud systems, and leverage them in production-ready solutions.
